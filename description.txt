Assignment:
You have been provided a .wav file with audio that gives a persons name, phone number, email address and policy number.
Your task is to transform this raw audio data into structured data JSON data using free or trial tools available on
the public internet.

Criteria:
You must write a python application which can be run locally, which accepts a .wav file like the sample you have been provided.
Use any available free or trial tool(s) to manipulate the audio bytes into structured data in the following format:

{
"name": "John Smith",
"phoneNumber": "6174301234",
"email": john.smith@gmail.com",
"policyNumber": "ABC123"
}

Stretch Goal:
Synthesize a new audio file confirming the phone number and asking a follow up question.

Bonus:
Your application is capable of taking either a .wav file as an upload, OR is capable of streaming the audio via the microphone.
